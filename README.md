# Ansible Collection for ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Cloud

The Ansible Collection for [ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Cloud](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/) provides Ansible content that enables users to automate the management of ITSM processes such as requests, problems, changes, and releases.

## Description

This collection is ideal for IT administrators, DevOps engineers, and automation specialists who work with ServiceDesk Plus Cloud and want to integrate its capabilities into their infrastructure automation workflows.

## Requirements

- **Ansible-Core**: >= 2.15.0
- **Python**: >= 3.6
- No additional Python libraries are required.
- A ServiceDesk Plus Cloud instance and OAuth credentials are required for module authentication.

## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install manageengine.sdp_cloud
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: manageengine.sdp_cloud
```

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install manageengine.sdp_cloud --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection. Use the following syntax to install version 1.0.0:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install manageengine.sdp_cloud:==1.0.0
```

See [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

   ```

## Use Cases

Here are a few common automation scenarios enabled by this collection:

1.  **Request Management**: Automatically create, update, and query requests during CI/CD pipelines or event-driven automation.
2.  **Problem Management**: Trigger problem records and manage their lifecycle in coordination with incident resolution.
3.  **Change Management**: Automate the creation and update of change requests during system patching or upgrades.
4.  **Release Management**: Automate release planning and deployment tracking.

## Modules

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [oauth_token](https://github.com/ManageEngine/manageengine.sdp_cloud/blob/main/plugins/modules/oauth_token.py) | Generate ManageEngine SDP Cloud OAuth Access Token  |
| [read_record](https://github.com/ManageEngine/manageengine.sdp_cloud/blob/main/plugins/modules/read_record.py) | Read API module for ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Cloud |
| [write_record](https://github.com/ManageEngine/manageengine.sdp_cloud/blob/main/plugins/modules/write_record.py) | Manage records (create, update, delete) in ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Cloud |

## Example Usage

### Configuration
To securely manage your API credentials, we recommend using a `credentials.yml` file (excluded from version control) or environment variables.

**`credentials.yml` template:**
```yaml
---
client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
refresh_token: "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
dc: "US" # Data Center (US, EU, IN, AU, CN, JP)
```

**Environment Variables (alternative):**

You can also set credentials as environment variables. These are used as fallbacks when module parameters are not provided:

- `SDP_CLOUD_AUTH_TOKEN` - Pre-generated OAuth access token
- `SDP_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID` - Zoho API Console Client ID
- `SDP_CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET` - Zoho API Console Client Secret
- `SDP_CLOUD_REFRESH_TOKEN` - Long-lived refresh token

```bash
export SDP_CLOUD_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
export SDP_CLOUD_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
export SDP_CLOUD_REFRESH_TOKEN="YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

When environment variables are set, you can omit the credential parameters from your playbooks:

```yaml
- name: Create a Request (credentials from env vars)
  manageengine.sdp_cloud.write_record:
    domain: "sdpondemand.manageengine.com"
    parent_module_name: "request"
    dc: "US"
    portal_name: "ithelpdesk"
    payload:
      subject: "Request created using env var auth"
```

### Playbook Examples

**Generate Token:**
```yaml
- name: Fetch OAuth Token
  manageengine.sdp_cloud.oauth_token:
    client_id: "{{ client_id }}"
    client_secret: "{{ client_secret }}"
    refresh_token: "{{ refresh_token }}"
    dc: "{{ dc }}"
  register: auth_token
```

**Get Request Details:**
```yaml
- name: Get Request Details
  manageengine.sdp_cloud.read_record:
    domain: "sdpondemand.manageengine.com"
    parent_module_name: "request"
    parent_id: "100"
    auth_token: "{{ auth_token.access_token }}"
    dc: "{{ dc }}"
    portal_name: "ithelpdesk"
```

**Create a Problem:**
```yaml
- name: Create a Problem
  manageengine.sdp_cloud.write_record:
    auth_token: "{{ auth_token.access_token }}"
    dc: "{{ dc }}"

    portal_name: "ithelpdesk"
    parent_module_name: "problem"
    payload:
      title: "Network Latency Issue"

      urgency: "High"
      impact: "High"
```

**Update a Problem:**
```yaml

  manageengine.sdp_cloud.write_record:
    auth_token: "{{ auth_token.access_token }}"
    dc: "{{ dc }}"
    domain: "sdpondemand.manageengine.com"
    portal_name: "ithelpdesk"
    parent_module_name: "problem"
    parent_id: "100"
    payload:
      title: "Updated Title"
      priority: "High"
```

**Create a Release:**
```yaml

    dc: "{{ dc }}"
    domain: "sdpondemand.manageengine.com"
    portal_name: "ithelpdesk"
    parent_module_name: "release"
    payload:
      title: "Q3 Application Release"
      description: "Rolling out new features for Q3"
      priority: "Normal"
```

**Delete a Problem:**
```yaml
- name: Delete a Problem
  manageengine.sdp_cloud.write_record:
    auth_token: "{{ auth_token.access_token }}"
    dc: "{{ dc }}"
    domain: "sdpondemand.manageengine.com"
    portal_name: "ithelpdesk"
    parent_module_name: "problem"
    parent_id: "100"
