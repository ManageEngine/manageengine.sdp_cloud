# Ansible Collection for ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Cloud

The Ansible Collection for [ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Cloud](https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/) provides Ansible content that enables users to automate the management of ITSM processes such as requests, problems, changes, and releases.

## Description

This collection is ideal for IT administrators, DevOps engineers, and automation specialists who work with ServiceDesk Plus Cloud and want to integrate its capabilities into their infrastructure automation workflows.

## Requirements

- **Ansible-Core**: >= 2.15.0
- **Python**: >= 3.6
- No additional Python libraries are required.
- A ServiceDesk Plus Cloud instance and OAuth credentials are required for module authentication.

## Installation

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install manageengine.sdp_cloud
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: manageengine.sdp_cloud
```

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install manageengine.sdp_cloud --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection. Use the following syntax to install version 1.0.0:

To securely manage your API credentials, we recommend using a `credentials.yml` file (excluded from version control) or environment variables.

**`credentials.yml` template:**
```yaml
---
client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
refresh_token: "YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
dc: "US" # Data Center (US, EU, IN, AU, CN, JP)
```

### Playbook Examples

**Generate Token:**
```yaml

    dc: "{{ dc }}"
  register: auth_token
```

**Get Request Details:**
```yaml

  manageengine.sdp_cloud.read_record:
    domain: "sdpondemand.manageengine.com"
    parent_module_name: "request"

    auth_token: "{{ auth_token.access_token }}"
    portal_name: "ithelpdesk"
```

**Create a Problem:**
